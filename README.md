## Purpose

The book claims "On the Fly". Its intent is to provide a comprehensive introduction to the relevant features regarding modern C++ (before 2020s).
Readers can choose interesting content according to the following table of content to learn and quickly familiarize the new features you would like to learn.
Readers should aware that all of these features are not required. It should be leart when you really need it.

At the same time, instead of grammar-only, the book introduces the historical background as simple as possible of its technical requirements, which provides great help in understanding why these features comes out.

In addition, The author would like to encourage that readers should be able to use modern C++ directly in their new projects and  migrate their old projects to modern C++ gradually after read the book.

## Targets

- This book assumes that readers are already familiar with traditional C++ (i.e. C++98 or earlier), at least they do not have any difficulty in reading traditional C++ code. In other words, those who have long experience in traditional C++ and people who desire to quickly understand the features of modern C++ in a short period of time are well suited to read the book;

- This book introduces to a certain extent of the dark magic of modern C++. However, these magics are very limited, they are not suitable for readers who want to learn advanced C++. The purpose of this book is offering a quick start for modern C++. Of course, advanced readers can also use this book to review and examine themselves on modern C++.
